```bash
MOLLIE_API_KEY=your_mollie_api_key
MOLLIE_REDIRECT_URL=https://your-store.com/checkout/payment
MEDUSA_URL=https://your-medusa-server.com

## Usage

Make sure that the selected payment methods are enabled in your Mollie origanization settings as well.

### Client-Side Integration

To integrate with your storefront, you'll need to implement the payment flow according to Mollie's and Medusa's documentation. Here's a basic example:

1. Create a payment session in your checkout flow
2. Redirect the customer to the Mollie payment page
3. Handle the webhook notifications to update the payment status
   
_Example integration using the [Medusa Next.js Starter](https://github.com/medusajs/nextjs-starter-medusa):_

### Supported Payment Methods

The plugin currently supports the following Mollie payment methods:

| Payment Method  | Provider ID                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Hosted Checkout | `pp_mollie-hosted-checkout_mollie` |
| iDEAL           | `pp_mollie-ideal_mollie`           |
| Credit Card     | `pp_mollie-card_mollie`            |
| Bancontact      | `pp_mollie-bancontact_mollie`      |
| Gift Card       | `pp_mollie-giftcard_mollie`        |
| PayPal          | `pp_mollie-paypal_mollie`          |
| Apple Pay       | `pp_mollie-apple-pay_mollie`       |

## Extending the Plugin

To add support for additional Mollie payment methods, create a new service in `src/providers/mollie/services` that extends the `MollieBase` class:

```typescript
import { PaymentMethod } from "@mollie/api-client";
import MollieBase from "../core/mollie-base";
import { PaymentOptions, PaymentProviderKeys } from "../types";

class MollieNewMethodService extends MollieBase {
  static identifier = "mollie-new-method";

  get paymentCreateOptions(): PaymentOptions {
    return {
      method: PaymentMethod.newMethod,
    };
  }
}

export default MollieNewMethodService;
```

Make sure to replace `new method` with the actual Mollie payment method ID. 

Export your new service from `src/providers/mollie/services/index.ts`. Then add your new service to the list of services in `src/providers/mollie/index.ts`.

## Local development and customization

In case you want to customize and test the plugin locally, refer to the [Medusa Plugin docs](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/plugins/create#3-publish-plugin-locally-for-development-and-testing).
